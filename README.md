## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

├── data/               # Data layer
│   ├── datasources/    # Remote (API) and Local (Database) data sources
│   ├── models/         # DTOs and data models
│   └── repositories/   # Repository implementations
├── domain/             # Business logic layer
│   ├── entities/       # Core business entities
│   ├── repositories/   # Repository interfaces
│   └── usecases/       # Business use cases

```

### 🎯 Design Patterns Used
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction layer for data access
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating configured Dio instances
- **Singleton Pattern**: For dependency injection container
- **Adapter Pattern**: Converting DTOs to domain entities
- **BLoC Pattern**: For state management and separation of UI from business logic
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Using GetIt for dependency injection and management

### 📦 Dependency Injection with GetIt

This project uses **GetIt Service Locator** as its dependency injection pattern, providing several key benefits:

#### Why GetIt Service Locator?

**1. Clean Architecture Support**
- Enables proper **Dependency Inversion Principle** - use cases depend on abstractions, not implementations
- Maintains clear separation between layers without tight coupling
- Framework-agnostic pattern that works in pure Dart classes (use cases, repositories)

**2. Lifecycle Management**
```dart
// Singletons for shared resources
sl.registerLazySingleton<RestCountriesApi>(() => api)
sl.registerLazySingleton<AppDatabase>(() => database)

// Factories for fresh instances per page  
sl.registerFactory(() => CountriesCubit(...))
```

**3. Testability**
- Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
- Each layer can be tested independently
- Simple test setup by replacing implementations in the service locator

**4. Clear Dependency Flow**
```dart
// Dependencies flow in one direction: Presentation → Domain ← Data
class CountriesPage extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => sl<CountriesCubit>()..loadCountries(),
      child: const CountriesView(),
    );
  }
}
```

**5. No Prop Drilling**
- Direct access to dependencies where needed
- Eliminates passing dependencies through multiple widget layers
- Keeps widget constructors clean and focused

#### Architecture Benefits vs Alternatives

| Pattern | Problem | GetIt Solution |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Constructor Injection Everywhere | Requires passing dependencies through multiple widget layers | Direct access without prop drilling |
| Provider Package | Tightly couples Flutter widgets to dependency management | Framework-agnostic, works in pure Dart |
| Manual Instantiation | Scattered object creation, hard to manage lifecycles | Centralized configuration with consistent lifecycle management |

#### Real-World Impact in This App

- **Performance**: BLoC cubits created as factories ensure fresh state per navigation
- **Memory Management**: Database and API clients as singletons prevent resource leaks
- **Maintainability**: Adding features only requires updating the injection container
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies point inward (presentation → domain ← data)
